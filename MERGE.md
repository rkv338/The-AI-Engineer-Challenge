# RAG PDF System Feature - Merge Instructions

This document provides instructions for merging the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) PDF system from the `feature/rag-pdf-system` branch back to the `main` branch.

## Changes Made

### API Changes (`api/`)
- Added `PyPDF2==3.0.1` and `python-dotenv==1.0.0` dependencies to `requirements.txt`
- Enhanced `app.py` with comprehensive RAG functionality:
  - **New imports**: Added aimakerspace library components and file upload handling
  - **PDF Upload Endpoint** (`/api/upload-pdf-rag`):
    - Accepts PDF file uploads
    - Uses `aimakerspace.text_utils.PDFLoader` to extract text
    - Uses `aimakerspace.text_utils.CharacterTextSplitter` to chunk text (1000 chars, 200 overlap)
    - Uses `aimakerspace.vectordatabase.VectorDatabase` to create embeddings
    - Returns PDF ID and processing status
  - **RAG Chat Endpoint** (`/api/chat-rag`):
    - Accepts user questions and PDF ID
    - Uses vector similarity search to find relevant chunks
    - Uses `aimakerspace.openai_utils.chatmodel.ChatOpenAI` for AI responses
    - Uses `aimakerspace.openai_utils.prompts` for structured prompting
    - Returns streaming responses with context-aware answers
  - **PDF List Endpoint** (`/api/pdfs`):
    - Lists all uploaded PDFs with metadata
  - **Global storage**: In-memory storage for PDF documents and vector databases

### Frontend Changes (`frontend/`)
- **PdfUploadRAG Component** (`frontend/src/app/components/PdfUploadRAG.tsx`):
  - Drag-and-drop PDF upload interface
  - File validation (PDF only, max 10MB)
  - Real-time upload status and error handling
  - PDF selection interface with visual feedback
  - Integration with parent component for state management
- **RAGChat Component** (`frontend/src/app/components/RAGChat.tsx`):
  - Chat interface specifically for PDF Q&A
  - Streaming responses from RAG system
  - Clear chat functionality
  - Empty state when no PDF is selected
- **RAGSystem Component** (`frontend/src/app/components/RAGSystem.tsx`):
  - Main orchestrator component combining upload and chat
  - State management for selected PDF
  - Clean separation of concerns
- **Updated Main Page** (`frontend/src/app/page.tsx`):
  - Added RAG system above regular chat
  - Updated description to mention PDF Q&A functionality

### Aimakerspace Library Integration
- **Text Processing**: Uses `PDFLoader` and `CharacterTextSplitter` for document processing
- **Vector Database**: Uses `VectorDatabase` with cosine similarity for semantic search
- **Embeddings**: Uses OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small model via `EmbeddingModel`
- **Chat Model**: Uses GPT-4o-mini via `ChatOpenAI` with streaming support
- **Prompting**: Uses structured prompts with `SystemRolePrompt` and `UserRolePrompt`

## Merge Instructions

### Option 1: GitHub Pull Request (Recommended)

1. **Push the feature branch to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/rag-pdf-system
   ```

2. **Create a Pull Request:**
   - Go to your GitHub repository
   - Click "Compare & pull request" for the `feature/rag-pdf-system` branch
   - Set the base branch to `main`
   - Add a descriptive title: "Add RAG system with PDF upload and intelligent document Q&A"
   - Add description of the changes made
   - Review the changes and create the PR

3. **Merge the Pull Request:**
   - Review any CI/CD checks
   - Click "Merge pull request"
   - Delete the feature branch when prompted

4. **Update local main branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   ```

### Option 2: GitHub CLI

1. **Push the feature branch:**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/rag-pdf-system
   ```

2. **Create and merge PR using GitHub CLI:**
   ```bash
   # Create the pull request
   gh pr create --title "Add RAG system with PDF upload and intelligent document Q&A" --body "This PR adds a comprehensive RAG system that allows users to upload PDFs and chat with them using AI-powered document understanding."
   
   # Merge the pull request
   gh pr merge --merge
   
   # Switch back to main and pull changes
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   ```

## Testing the Feature

After merging, you can test the RAG system:

1. **Start the API server:**
   ```bash
   cd api
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python app.py
   ```

2. **Start the frontend:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Test the RAG system:**
   - Upload a PDF file using the drag-and-drop interface
   - Wait for indexing to complete
   - Select the uploaded PDF
   - Ask questions about the PDF content
   - Verify that responses are contextually relevant
   - Test with multiple PDFs

## Environment Variables Required

Ensure these environment variables are set:
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key for embeddings and chat
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY`: Frontend access to OpenAI API key

## Deployment Notes

- The API endpoints will be automatically deployed to Vercel when merged to main
- The frontend changes will also be deployed automatically
- Ensure the `PyPDF2` and `python-dotenv` dependencies are properly installed
- The aimakerspace library is included in the repository and will be deployed

## Performance Considerations

- **Memory Usage**: PDF documents and vector databases are stored in memory
- **File Size Limits**: 10MB maximum PDF size
- **Chunking Strategy**: 1000-character chunks with 200-character overlap
- **Search Results**: Top 3 most relevant chunks used for context
- **Streaming**: Real-time response streaming for better UX

## Cleanup

After successful merge:
```bash
# Delete the local feature branch
git branch -d feature/rag-pdf-system

# Delete the remote feature branch (if using GitHub PR method)
git push origin --delete feature/rag-pdf-system
```

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future iterations:
- Persistent storage for PDF documents and vector databases
- Support for more document types (DOCX, TXT, etc.)
- Advanced chunking strategies (semantic chunking)
- User authentication and document ownership
- Conversation history persistence
- Advanced search filters and metadata
